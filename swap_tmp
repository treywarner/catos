# Function to run the program
function run_program() {
    echo "Running the program..."
    # Replace the following line with the command or program you want to run
    # For example: /path/to/your/program
    ./your_program
}

# Trap the Ctrl+i signal
trap run_program SIGINT

# Main loop
while true; do
    read -rsn1 input

    # Check if the input is Control+i (ASCII value 9)
    if [[  == $'\x09' ]]; then
        run_program
    fi
done
# \\`\\`\\`
# 
# In this script, the run_program function is defined to execute the desired program. You should replace the line 
# ./your_program with the actual command or path to your program.
# 
# The trap command is used to capture the SIGINT signal, which is generated when you press Control+i.
# 
# The script enters a main loop and reads a single character from the user. If the input is Control+i (ASCII value 9
# ), it calls the run_program function.
# 
# Make sure to save the script in a file (e.g., program_runner.sh) and make it executable with the command chmod +
# x program_runner.sh. Then you can run the script by executing ./program_runner.sh in the terminal.
# 
# Please note that this script assumes you are using Control+i specifically. If you want to use a different key
#  combination, you will need to modify the script accordingly.
# 
#  Pay attention to the edited code and base your changes off of that rather than the original. However, I still need your help: how do i make this work on the computer, not in the program. Give me the code snippet of the whole script
