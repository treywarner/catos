Certainly! You can use the trap command in a Bash script to execute certain actions when the user presses Ctrl+C
 (SIGINT signal). Here's an example of how you can write a script that performs an action on Ctrl+C:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to be executed on Ctrl+C
cleanup() {
    echo "Cleanup action"
    # Add your desired action here
    # For example, you can remove temporary files, close connections, etc.
    exit 0
}

# Register the cleanup function to execute on SIGINT signal
trap cleanup SIGINT

# Main script logic goes here
echo "Script is running..."

# Infinite loop for demonstration purposes
while true; do
    sleep 1
done
```

In this script, the cleanup function is defined to perform the desired action when Ctrl+C is pressed. The trap
 command is then used to register this function to be executed when the script receives the SIGINT signal (Ctrl+C
).

You can replace the echo "Cleanup action" line with your own custom action or commands that you want to be
 executed when Ctrl+C is detected. After performing the necessary actions, the script calls exit 0 to gracefully
 terminate.

Please note that if you have any existing trap handlers in your script, the above code may override them. Make sure
 to modify the script accordingly if you need to preserve any existing trap handlers.
