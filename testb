Give me the code snippet 

Certainly! Here's a bash shell script that sets an environment variable if it is not already set:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the environment variable is already set
if [[ -z "$YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME" ]]; then
    YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME="your_default_value"
    export YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME
    echo "Environment variable YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME set to: $YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME"
else
    echo "Environment variable YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME is already set to: $YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME"
fi
```

Replace YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME with the name of your desired environment variable and "your_default_value" with the
 default value you want to set if the variable is not already defined.

Save the script to a file (e.g., set_variable.sh), make it executable (chmod +x set_variable.sh), and run it
 using ./set_variable.sh. The script will check if the environment variable is already set and set it to the
 default value if it is not.
