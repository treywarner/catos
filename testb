Give me the code snippet 

Certainly! You can create a bash shell script and add it to the startup applications in Ubuntu to run all the
 programs in a specific folder when your computer starts. Here's an example code snippet:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Change directory to the desired folder containing the programs
cd /path/to/folder

# Loop through all the files in the folder
for program in *
do
    # Check if the file is executable (a program)
    if [ -x "$program" ]
    then
        # Run the program in the background
        ./"$program" &
    fi
done
```

Make sure to replace /path/to/folder with the actual path to the folder that contains your programs. Save the
 script with a .sh extension, for example startup.sh.

To add the script to the startup applications:

1. Open the Startup Applications Preferences window. You can search for "Startup Applications" in the Ubuntu Dash
 or find it in the system settings menu.
2. Click on the "Add" button to add a new startup application.
3. In the "Name" field, enter a name for the startup item (e.g., "Run Programs").
4. In the "Command" field, enter the full path to the shell script you created (e.g., /path/to/startup.sh).
5. Optionally, you can provide a description for the startup item in the "Comment" field.
6. Click "Add" to save the startup item.

Now, every time you start your computer, the shell script will be executed, running all the programs in the
 specified folder.
